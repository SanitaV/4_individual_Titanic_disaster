##  Python individual work - learning from Titanic disaster

**Assignment Title: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python Pandas**

*Objective: In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with Python Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. You will use the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a visualization using Matplotlib pyplot.*

**Instructions:**

1. Dataset Acquisition:
       - Obtain the Titanic dataset. You can download it from reputable sources such as Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or use datasets available directly through Python libraries.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      - Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
      - Use Pandas methods to explore and understand the dataset:
        * Display the first few rows to get an overview of the data structure.
        * Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
        * Identify missing values and decide on strategies for handling them.
        * Compute basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns.
        * Analyze categorical variables (e.g., value counts).

3. Data Visualization:
      - Choose one column of the dataset that interests you
      - Use Matplotlib pyplot to create a meaningful visualization:
         * Select an appropriate plot type (e.g., bar chart, histogram, pie chart).
         * Label axes, add a title.
         * Ensure the visualization is clear, informative, and visually appealing. smile
